# dnie-pkcs11-tester

This program is just a lttle PKCS#11 tester for the DNIe (Spanish eID). It is intended to be used with the pkcs11 library provided by Opensc.

The auto-tools can be used for compilng it. You need the the PKCS#11 library provided by OpenSC (or another one if you are testing another implementation) and openssl installed in your machine.

    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure --with-pkcs11=/path/to/pkcs/pkcs11.so
    make

This creates a _dnie-pkcs11-tester_ in the current directory you can execute.

If you want you can compile by yourself (maybe it is easier) just execute a command like this:

    gcc -I. dnie-pkcs11-tester.c -o dnie-pkcs11-tester \
    -Wl,-rpath=/path/to/pkcs /path/to/pkcs/pkcs11.so -lcrypto

The _rpath_ is important to fix that pkcs11 library to the resulting binary (you can also use LD_PRELOAD if you do not want to use rpath).

Finally the current status of the tests which are executed is the following:

  Usage: dnie-pkcs11-tester {OPTIONS}
